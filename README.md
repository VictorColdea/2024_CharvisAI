# 2024_CharvisAI

Project in Python to connect to Open AI's ChatGPT API client, and scrape the Churchill College website (and Wikipedia page) for real-time Churchill College-related information. Also used speech-to-text input to allow user to speak to computer, and had text-to-speech output. Output also used a virtual avatar in the advanced version, which used an image of choice of a face that appeared to speak the output.
The more basic version did not involve scraping the website or the avatar.
